1. When the transmit ring is full, my implementation returns an error value,
   indicating to the network server that it has to resend the packet.

   if empty), and the network server blocks until a packet is ready.
3. This file came from JOS. Cheesy web page!
4. 5 hours for part A. 12 hours for part B.  hours for challenge.
