1. No, because eflags are saved and restored by the trapframe.

Challenge: I implemented background commands (&) and multiple commands per line (;).
  I did this by adding additional cases in the token switch statement, and using the

  either immediately go back to the shell (&)
  or wait for the first command to finish before moving on to the right-hand-side (;)
