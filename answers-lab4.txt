1. mpentry must run from the lower 2^16 bytes, starting at MPENTRY_PADDR.
   However, the linker links everything after KERNBASE, so the code must
   manually offset the addresses to refer to their corresponding addresses
   at MPENTRY_PADDR.
2. We only acquire the kernel lock in the trap function, after _alltraps,
   which places the trapframe on the stack. With a shared stack, if a trap
   occurs while another cpu is in kernel mode, _alltraps will modify the
   stack while the other cpu is running.
3. The envs array is mapped to the same address in all environments, so even
   after switching to a different address space the address of e is the same.
4. Because when you start running a new environment, the cpu will overwrite
   the registers. The old registers are saved in env->env_tf in trap().
