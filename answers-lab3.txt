1. The ability to store the trap number and error code.
2. The user program is not allowed to call page faults directly, so it runs
   into permission issues resulting in trap 13. If we did allow it to call a
   page fault, then for now it wouldn't do much because we haven't implemented
   the page fault handler yet, but in the future user programs would be able to
   request all of the computer's memory even if it wasn't using it.
